## Problem and Design Overview

Synchro Studio's interface presents several usability barriers for traffic engineers and planners. Users encounter
inefficiencies when navigating the Scenario Manager, incosistent menu layouts, and unintuitive data input
workflows. These issues hinder productivity and create a steep learning curve, especially for new users.

Our redesign addresses these challenges by creating a more cohesive and intuitive interface. Key improvements includes:
- A customizable Quick Access Pop-Up Bar for frequently used tools.
- Click-based map interactions for direct, contextual data input.
- A Consistent UI layout across all setting menus for better usability.

## Design Walkthrough

### Adding Two Left Turn Lanes (Novice Task)

**Context:** A user wants to improve traffic flow at an intersection by adding left-turn lanes. This is a mid-complexity
 task common in congestion mitigation.

**Walkthrough:**
- Users click a road segment to bring up lane settings.
- A streamlined menu allows for quick adjustment of turn lanes.
- A hover-triggered submenu offers lane options.
- A dropdown lets users select the number of lanes.
- System logic prevents addings more lanes than possible for the connected road.

**Design Insight:** The Interface was generally intuitive, though participants were briefly confused by  the hover-triggered
submenu.

**Change Made:** We revised the interaction to improve feedback and are considering click-based submenu activation.

### Customizing QuickBar with Phasing Settings (Experienced Task)

**Context:** An experienced user wants to add Phasing Settings to their QuickBar to improve workflow efficiency in coordinating
traffic lights.

**Walkthrough:** 
- Clicking the customization buttons "+" or "-" activates QuickBar customization mode with a green outline.
- Users select or remove tools via direct clicks.
- Tooltips clarify the purpose of each button.

**Design Insight:** Users were confused by the green highlight and what it indicated.

**Change Made:** We added tooltips and visible labels/messages to clarify actions and improve feedback.

## Design Research and Key Insights

### Research Summary

**Goals:**
Identify key usability bottlenecks in Synchro Studio and understand user pain points.

**Methods:**
- Survey (2 responses)
- 2 interviews (10 minutes each)

**Participants:** 
Students in TCE 327 with with actual Synchro Studio experience.

**Rationale:**
These methods offered insights into both novice and frequent user experiences, guiding redesign priorities.

### Key Insights

**Insight 1: Users Avoid Unfamiliar Tools**
- **Emergence:** Students reported using only what was taught in class and ignoring unexplained features.
- **Evidence:** "I don't touch the reports or random extra tabs because I don't know what they do."
"There are a bunch of things in the menus I've never clicked."
- **Impact:** We embedded tooltips, clearer labels, and simplified menues to enhance discoverability without
overwhelming users.

**#### Insight 2: UI Feels Overwhelming**
- **Emergence:** Students described the interface as bloated and visually cluttered, especially for first-time users.
- **Evidence:** "There's just too much going on and not enough help."
"Every setting is there, but it's overwhelming when you're new."
- **Impact:** We consolodated tool menus, implemented a customizable QuickBar, and emphasized clean visual groupings.

**#### Insight 3: Tasks Are Tedious and Fragmented**
- **Emergence:** Students felt that even small adjustments took too long, with constant back-and-forth between menus
and settings.
- **Evidence:** "It's not loading slowâ€”it's just too many steps over and over"
"You need 3-4 tabs just to edit something small for 30 minutes."
**Impact:** We introduced direct map editing and feedback indicators to reduce context switching and give
users faster results from their actions.

## Iterative Design and Key Learnings

### Process Summary
We began with paper prototyping and conducted usability testing. We then transitioned to the digital mockup in Figma
based on feedback recieved. The Hueristic evaluations informed interface refinements.Enhancements focused on feedback 
clarity, simplification, and interaction logic.

### Paper Prototype:

### Digital Mockup:

## Key Iteration Insights
**Insight 1:** Visual Feedback Improves Usability
- **Emergence:** Confusion over customization modes.
- **Evidence:** Testers misunderstood green highlight.
- **Change:** Added green outlines, tooltips, and messages to clarify add/remove modes.

**Insight 2:** Lane Logic Needs Simplification
- **Emergence:** Complex lane configurations confused uers.
- **Evidence:** Usability tests showed hesitation around submenu use.
- **Change:** Limited functionality to left turn lanes with logic constraints to match receiving lanes.

**Insight 3:** Tool Management Should Be Modular
- **Emergence:** Users disliked last-in-first-out logic
- **Evidence:** Inability to remove a specific tool.
- **Change:** Switched to direct selection for removal, improving control and transparency.
